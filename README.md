Game ideas

View from the side

start with one room. add more later if neccessary.
stationary
avoid death and collect coins/points.
switch between items as game progresses.
Types of enemies
traps
depending on level, it could be killing enemies, collecting coins, or having random level modifiers like gravity or faster enemies.
Music

Use java swing for the GUI
keylistener for controls
